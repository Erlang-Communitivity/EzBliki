First off, caveat emptor...EzBliki is in alpha state, use at your own risk.

Note: EzBliki has only been tested on the following OS's:
  Mac OS 10.4.1
  Mac OS 10.5.2

To build, make sure that you have installed Erlang 12B2 or higher and that you are using the bash shell, then that you can execute erlang. Once you have confirmed that you can build by typing 
  ./build
at the prompt.

To run type 
  ./run
at the prompt.

You may need to change the computer name in some of the scripts to match your hostname. The test host name was Signal-2.
