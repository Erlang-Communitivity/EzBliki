== Atom Protocol Exerciser (APE)

APE is a sanity-checker for implementations of the Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub or APP). It is written in Ruby,
and provides a Mongrel-based HTML interface describing its interactions with the APP implementation under test.

For more information about the history and impetus for the creation of APE, see Tim Bray's account here[http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/11/Meet-the-Ape].
